# Hi, I'm Geddy Dukes

AI and ML Systems Engineer focused on building fast, reliable, production-grade AI systems from first principles.

I implement research papers, train models from scratch, and ship real systems that run on consumer hardware.

## About Me

I build AI systems by understanding them from the ground up. My experience in finance showed me where AI breaks in real-world, regulated environments, so I focus on systems that are transparent, auditable, and reliable.

**I care about:**
- Clear reasoning and reproducibility
- First-principles engineering
- Efficiency under constraints
- Making research ideas work in production

**Experience:**
- Built fintech systems processing millions
- Implemented JEPA, CPC, CLIP from papers
- Published open-source agent runtime
- Trained full transformer models from scratch

**Education:**
- M.S. Analytics, Georgia Tech (2026)
- B.S. Computer Science, WGU (2026)
- B.S. Business Administration, WGU (2024)
- Software Engineering Immersive, General Assembly (2020)
